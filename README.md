RP2 : Performing a descriptive analysis of the variables
Choose the definitive topic of our study, describe the specific variables we consider, explain how we collect the data, and predict what relationships we expect to find. 

RP3 : Planning for analysis
Research the method(s) we will apply to the dataset and explain the concepts related to the method. Explain how we will assess the fit of the model, what types of predictions or inferences we will make based on your model.

RP4 : The combination of RP2 and RP3.
